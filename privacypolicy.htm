      <p><h2>Log Data</h2></p>
      <p>
         I want to inform you that whenever you
         use Measury, in a case of an error in the app
         I collect data and information (through third party
         products) on your phone called Log Data. This Log Data may
         include information such as your device Internet Protocol
         ("IP") address, device name, operating system version, the
         configuration of the app when utilizing Measury,
         the time and date of your use of the Service, and other
         statistics.
      </p>
      <p><h2>Cookies</h2></p>
      <p>
         Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
         commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
         to your browser from the websites that you visit and are
         stored on your device's internal memory.
      </p>
      <p>
         Measury does not use these "cookies" explicitly. However,
         the app may use third party code and libraries that use
         "cookies" to collect information and improve their services.
         You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
         and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you
         choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some
         portions of Measury.
      </p>
      <p><h2>Service Providers</h2></p>
      <p>
         I may employ third-party companies and
         individuals due to the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
         <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>
         <li>To provide the Service on our behalf;</li>
         <li>To perform Service-related services; or</li>
         <li>To assist us in analyzing how Measury is used.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
         I want to inform users of Measury
         that these third parties have access to your Personal
         Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
         them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
         disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
      </p>
      <p><h2>Security</h2></p>
      <p>
         I value your trust in providing us your
         Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
         acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
         of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
         storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
         guarantee its absolute security.
      </p>
      <p><h2>Links to Other Sites</h2></p>
      <p>
         Measury contains links to other sites. If you click on
         a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Note
         that these external sites are not operated by us.
         Therefore, I advise you to review the
         Privacy Policy of these websites. I have
         no control over and assume no responsibility for the content,
         privacy policies, or practices of any third-party sites or

      <p><h2>Childrenâ€™s Privacy</h2></p>
      <p>
         These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13.
         I do not knowingly collect personally
         identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
         I discover that a child under 13 has provided
         us with personal information, I immediately
         delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
         and you are aware that your child has provided us with
         personal information, please contact us so that
         I will be able to do necessary actions.
      </p>
